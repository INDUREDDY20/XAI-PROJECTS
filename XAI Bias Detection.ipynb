    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models used in high-stakes applications often inherit biases from historical data, \n",
    "leading to unfair decisions across demographic groups. Since most models operate as black boxes, \n",
    "identifying and understanding the causes of such bias is challenging. \n",
    "Existing approaches mainly quantify bias without explaining it. Therefore, there is a need for an XAI-based bias detection system that can detect, quantify, and explain biased model behavior to support fair and ethical AI deployment."

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The project utilizes the **Adult Census Income Dataset** sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, a widely recognized benchmark dataset for research in machine learning fairness, bias detection, and ethical AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of demographic and socioeconomic information extracted from the **1994 U.S. Census**. Each record represents an individual and includes attributes such as age, education level, occupation, work class, marital status, race, gender, capital gain, capital loss, and hours worked per week. The objective is to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds **$50,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of sensitive attributes such as **gender (sex)** and **race** makes this dataset particularly suitable for studying algorithmic bias and fairness. In this project, **gender** is used as the primary sensitive attribute for bias detection and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature transformation. Due to its real-world origin and well-documented bias patterns, the Adult Census Income dataset serves as an effective benchmark for evaluating bias detection and explainability using **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques.\n",

    "This project presented an end-to-end XAI-based bias detection framework for machine learning models using a real-world dataset. Exploratory data analysis revealed demographic imbalance, indicating a high risk of biased predictions. Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated, showing that higher accuracy does not necessarily imply fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias was quantitatively measured using standard fairness metrics, which confirmed disparities in predictions across sensitive groups. To overcome the lack of transparency in traditional models, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied. SHAP and LIME provided both global and local explanations, clearly identifying the factors contributing to biased decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the study demonstrates that integrating fairness metrics with XAI enables transparent, interpretable, and ethical evaluation of machine learning models. The proposed approach improves trust and accountability in AI systems and is suitable for deployment in high-stakes, real-world applications."
